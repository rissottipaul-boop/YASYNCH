# Design System: Telegram Turntable

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Record Crate"**

Telegram Turntable is a private listening instrument for a personal collection that happens to live in Telegram. The system is bold, chic, and focused: editorial typography, restrained surfaces, deliberate density, and a single burgundy stamp signal give the interface confidence without competing with the music or artwork.

The visual language treats the library as a curated crate rather than a generic streaming catalog. Source context remains close to the track, controls stay available without shouting, and depth is used to explain the relationship between the library, Now Playing, menus, and the persistent player. It explicitly rejects generic streaming-service sameness, dashboard-like clutter, playful consumer-app decoration, neon music-player clichés, and opaque Telegram utility chrome.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Editorial Be Vietnam Pro headlines with precise mono labels.
- Warm tinted neutrals in both light and dark themes.
- Restrained palette with a burgundy stamp reserved for playback and meaningful status.
- Dense, scan-friendly library rows with generous separation between functional regions.
- Quiet layered elevation for panels, menus, and the persistent player.

## 1.1 Redesign contract

The redesign keeps the Record Crate identity while making the relationship between moving content and a small number of physical interface layers explicit.

### Product mode

Operate / music-library application.

### Core identity

- Warm paper
- Smoked glass
- Album artwork
- Catalogue typography
- Burgundy stamp playback indication
- Subtle grain

### Signature effect

Content physically scrolls beneath a 36px progressive glass layer with a strong header-specific tint and a falloff that extends 70px beyond the reserved header space, so the title and toolbar stay in the strongest frosted zone and the first sharp track emerges below the toolbar. Glass belongs where a surface overlays moving content, not on every component.

### Blur scale

- `0px` = normal content
- `20px` = secondary glass
- `36px` = signature glass

### TURNTable MATERIAL HIERARCHY

36px progressive
- library header only

36px uniform
- bottom player dock
- right Now Playing panel
- compact Now Playing header
- global search results

20px uniform editor glass
- Settings
- Metadata Editor
- Lyrics Editor

0px
- all ordinary content
- source rail
- track rows
- queue rows
- Details
- context menu
- generic dialogs
- all scrims/backdrops

`backdrop-filter` alone does not qualify as implemented glass. The surface must use a translucent material and have meaningful content physically behind it.

### Accent

Burgundy stamp only. Use it for meaningful playback or status indication, not decoration.

### Typography

- **Be Vietnam Pro** = UI and display typography
- **JetBrains Mono** = metadata and catalogue/data typography

Do not introduce another font for the redesign.

### Motion

Motion is restrained and purposeful. UI state uses `--ease-out` only; overshoot/spring easings are reserved for genuine physical interactions (drag-and-drop release) and must never drive buttons, rows, transport, or overlays. Preserve existing interaction choreography and always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Additional anti-patterns

- No glass on every component
- No purple/blue AI gradients
- No random glow
- No decorative waveform spam
- No arbitrary new fonts

### Glass decision rule

Before adding a glass background to a new button or component, ask whether it overlays moving content or represents a deliberate physical layer. Usually the answer is no. Normal controls should generally use a transparent or quiet surface treatment.

## 2. Colors

The palette is a restrained warm-neutral field: old paper and ivory in light mode, charred paper and warm graphite in dark mode, with a burgundy stamp acting as the occasional physical mark of playback.

### Primary
- **Stamp** (#7d3140): Playback progress, current-track marks, meaningful active states, and selected music signals in light mode.
- **Stamp Dark** (#a6475b): The same signal in dark mode, tuned for contrast against charred paper.

### Neutral
- **Charred Paper** (#12100e): Dark-theme page canvas.
- **Blackened Rail** (#080706): Dark-theme source navigation rail.
- **Warm Graphite** (#1b1815): Dark-theme raised surfaces and control backgrounds.
- **Old Ivory** (#f2efe8): Dark-theme primary text and high-emphasis controls.
- **Ash** (#a39c92): Dark-theme secondary text, timestamps, and quiet metadata.
- **Paper Light** (#faf9f6): Light-theme page canvas and inverse control text.
- **Rail Light** (#f2f0ea): Light-theme source navigation rail.
- **Surface Light** (#ffffff): Light-theme raised surfaces and controls.
- **Ink Light** (#14110f): Light-theme primary text and primary controls.
- **Graphite Light** (#6b655d): Light-theme secondary text and metadata.
- **Rule Dark** (#332e29) and **Rule Soft Dark** (#24211d): Dark-theme dividers and quiet boundaries.
- **Rule Light** (#ddd8ce) and **Rule Soft Light** (#ebe7df): Light-theme dividers and quiet boundaries.

### Named Rules

**The Stamp Rule.** The burgundy stamp is a signal, not a decoration. Use it for playback position, current-track state, errors, or other meaningful status; do not turn the whole interface burgundy.

**The Tinted Neutral Rule.** Never introduce pure black, pure white, or un-tinted gray as a new surface or text color. Use the existing warm neutrals and their semantic roles.

## 3. Typography

- **Display Font:** Be Vietnam Pro (with Avenir, Segoe UI, and system sans fallbacks)
- **Body Font:** Be Vietnam Pro (with Avenir, Segoe UI, and system sans fallbacks)
- **Label/Mono Font:** JetBrains Mono (with SFMono-Regular and monospace fallbacks)

**Character:** Be Vietnam Pro gives the player a clean, confident geometric voice without becoming theatrical. JetBrains Mono reserves precision for timestamps, source labels, counts, and system-like metadata.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (500, `clamp(32px, 5vw, 44px)`, `.98 line-height`, `-.04em`): Library view titles and primary screen headings.
- **Headline** (520, `28px`, `1.1 line-height`, `-.035em`): Modal and Now Playing titles.
- **Title** (550, `22px`, `1.2 line-height`, `-.025em`): Section headings and important secondary titles.
- **Body** (400, `15px`, `1.45 line-height`): Track names, descriptive copy, and controls that need comfortable reading.
- **Label** (500, `11px`, `.085em`, uppercase): Source types, timestamps, counts, and operational metadata.

### Named Rules

**The Two-Register Rule.** Use Be Vietnam Pro for human content and hierarchy. Use JetBrains Mono for data, labels, time, and system state. Do not mix the registers within a single phrase without a clear semantic reason.

**The Scan-Length Rule.** Keep prose around 65–75 characters per line where possible. Let track and source names truncate gracefully rather than destabilizing the grid.

## 4. Elevation

The system uses quiet layered shadows over tonal layering. Most library content remains flat and scannable; elevation appears when a surface floats above that content, such as the Now Playing panel, context menu, search results, dialogs, and persistent player. Dark mode uses tinted near-black shadows so surfaces separate without glowing.

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Flat** (`box-shadow: none`): Library canvas, ordinary rows, and resting structural regions.
- **Edge** (`0 1px 2px var(--shadow-color)`): Small controls, artwork, and active icon-rail items.
- **Panel** (`0 12px 30px var(--shadow-color)`): Search results, Now Playing, and floating utility surfaces.
- **Deep** (`0 24px 72px var(--shadow-color-strong)`): Dialogs and high-priority overlays.
- **Panel seam** (`-18px 0 38px var(--shadow-color), var(--elev-2)`): The docked Now Playing panel, clarifying its boundary with the library.

### Named Rules

**The Structural Shadow Rule.** Shadows explain a surface's relationship to the rest of the player. They should not make flat rows look like cards or add decoration to already-clear boundaries.

## 5. Components

### Buttons
- **Shape:** Compact, square, and tactile with a `2px` control radius.
- **Primary:** Ink background with paper text in light mode, and Old Ivory background with Charred Paper text in dark mode; `40px` height and `0 15px` horizontal padding.
- **Hover / Focus:** Increase border or surface contrast; keyboard focus uses the shared two-step focus ring, which appears instantly and never animates in. Active controls may scale subtly, never bounce.
- **Secondary / Ghost / Tertiary:** Surface-filled secondary buttons use a quiet rule; icon buttons are `40px` square with transparent rest state and tonal hover feedback.

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** `6px` for panels and dialogs, `2px` for controls, `2px` for artwork and compact surfaces.
- **Background:** Use Paper for the canvas, Rail for navigation, Surface for controls and panels, and Surface Raised only when a layer needs a small tonal lift.
- **Shadow Strategy:** Reference the Edge, Panel, and Deep roles in Elevation. Avoid cardifying ordinary library rows.
- **Border:** Use the warm rule tokens for boundaries and separators; do not add colored side stripes.
- **Internal Padding:** Use the spacing scale, generally `12px`, `18px`, `24px`, or `32px` according to component weight.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** `42px` tall, `12px` horizontal padding, `2px` radius, Paper background, and a warm Rule border.
- **Focus:** Use the shared `--focus-ring` with a clear border shift, never a color-only or glow-only indicator.
- **Error / Disabled:** Use semantic Danger with supporting copy; disabled controls retain their shape and hierarchy while reducing opacity and removing interaction affordances.

### Navigation
- **Style:** The source rail is a stable, left-aligned navigation surface with compact source rows, circular artwork, source metadata, and counts.
- **Default / Hover / Active:** Resting rows are quiet and separated by rules; hover shifts to Surface; active rows use a Surface shift and preserve the stamp for playback rather than a colored stripe.
- **Collapsed treatment:** The rail becomes a compact icon navigation column. Labels and counts hide, source action menus become hover/focus overlays, and active items gain a subtle inset boundary.
- **Responsive treatment:** On smaller screens the source rail becomes a drawer above the library and stops above the persistent player.

### Player Bar
- **Shape:** A persistent `96px` floating control surface spanning the shell, with identity, transport, volume, and track actions in the first row and the native progress rail integrated along the lower edge.
- **Hierarchy:** Track identity anchors the left, transport owns the center, and volume plus secondary actions sit to the right. The primary Play control is the strongest control by size and contrast.
- **Behavior:** Keep seeking, playback state, and transport controls available while Now Playing or source navigation changes. Respect reduced motion.

### Track Rows
- **Shape:** Dense `64px` rows with `48px` artwork and aligned mono metadata columns.
- **State:** Ordinary rows stay flat; hover uses a surface shift; the current row uses a restrained stamp tint and a small playback mark.
- **Overflow:** Track titles, artists, and source names truncate with ellipses while timestamps and counts remain aligned.

## 5.1 Final component rules

### Library header
- Progressive **36px glass**, one physical plane, strong tint through the toolbar (`--header-glass-top` = 84% paper), mask anchored at 64/72/82/92%.
- The source title takes a **full row on desktop**: one line, truncating with ellipsis past the viewport; wrapping returns at `<=860px`.
- Play/Shuffle and the toolbar sit on a second row beneath the title at `>=861px`.
- Search is a **low-chrome command surface**: 34px, translucent rest state, ink border on focus, `Search tracks` copy; `/` focuses it when no dialog is open.
- Sort is a **menu trigger** (`.sort-trigger`) that reuses the shared context-menu popover; the hidden `#track-sort` select remains the state source and the track-head sorts re-sync the visible label.

### Player dock
- **Uniform 36px glass**, one glass body: `--glass-medium` background, `blur(36px)`, `16px` insets on the paper canvas, no progressive mask.
- Progress row is part of the same material: transparent background, 32% glass border.
- Fixed left identity/action zone at `>=1121px`: track capped at `min(440px, 50vw - 230px)`, actions in a fixed 134px column, so the action edge never moves with title length; the title truncates first.
- **Transport physically centered** at `>=1121px` (absolute at 50%); 861–1120 keeps the in-flow three-column grid; `<=860px` keeps the two-row mobile player with the transport on its own row.
- Transport spacing: 14px gaps, 8px play margins; shuffle/repeat stay quiet mode controls with no boxed cluster.

### Now Playing
- Expanded disc up to **188px** (56% / 30dvh cap) with an 18px band before the title; panel width unchanged; no art glow or gradient.
- Active lyric line is typographically distinct (650 vs 520 weight, ink color); no glow, pulse, karaoke gradient, or red.
- Queue suppresses redundant default labels: only Played/Playing render, upcoming rows carry no `Up next`/`queued` noise, cache badges appear only for real prefetch states; current-row wash is 10%.
- Details actions are a compact wrapping row of 34px text buttons.

### Source rail
- Source sort is a **compact menu trigger** reusing the shared popover; drag reordering forces Custom order and re-syncs localStorage and the label.
- Expanded global search stays a full field at 38px with a quiet rest state; collapsed mode unboxes the 46px target until hover/focus.
- Repeated per-source ellipsis hides until row interaction; active rows and keyboard focus still reveal it.
- Sync / Add / **Settings share one `.rail-utility-button` geometry** (18px icon column, 9px inset); Settings has a gear icon and stays available when the rail is collapsed.
- The collapse chevron rotates with state and aria/title always match; the collapsed state restores from localStorage.

### Settings
- **20px secondary glass**: translucent raised modal, dim-only backdrop.
- Stable two-column frame; content viewport is a fixed 300px that scrolls per-pane, so the dialog never resizes between tabs.
- Theme segmented control capped at 380px; Network uses explicit vertical radio-like rows; no category-icon clutter.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** keep listening, playback, and track discovery as the clearest path through every screen.
- **Do** use Be Vietnam Pro for hierarchy and JetBrains Mono for time, counts, labels, and system state.
- **Do** use the burgundy stamp only as a meaningful playback or status signal.
- **Do** preserve source provenance near tracks and source navigation.
- **Do** use spacing to separate regions: tight `4–12px` groups, then `18–32px` structural gaps.
- **Do** keep ordinary library content flat and use elevation for floating relationships.
- **Do** provide visible keyboard focus, reduced-motion behavior, usable contrast, and non-color status cues.

### Don't:
- **Don't** make the interface feel like generic streaming-service sameness.
- **Don't** introduce dashboard-like clutter, playful consumer-app decoration, or opaque Telegram utility chrome.
- **Don't** use neon music-player clichés or turn the interface into a glowing entertainment dashboard.
- **Don't** make the interface feel like an admin panel, a social feed, or a marketing landing page.
- **Don't** add visual novelty that competes with the track, artwork, or listening flow.
- **Don't** use pure black, pure white, gradient text, colored side stripes, decorative glassmorphism, or nested cards.
- **Don't** hide essential transport controls on touch screens or rely on color alone to communicate state.
