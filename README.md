<h1 align="center">Telegram Turntable</h1>

<p align="center">A self-hosted web music player for audio you already have in Telegram.</p>

Point it at the chats, channels and bots holding your audio and it indexes them into a local
library with a player on top, streaming each file from Telegram on demand rather than keeping a
second copy of your collection.

A fun side project, not a product. Single user.

> **Security first:** the player binds to `127.0.0.1` with no password by default — safe on a
> personal machine, unsafe the moment it is reachable from a network. Anyone who reaches this
> app is logged into **your** Telegram account. Set a password and bind to `0.0.0.0` only
> behind a VPN or a reverse proxy with TLS. **Sign out** in Settings keeps the library you
> already synced and revokes only the browser session — clearing your sources is the choice
> that erases tracks, play counts and the media cache. See [Security](#security).

## What it does

- **Indexes any chat, channel, bot or Saved Messages** you choose, and syncs new tracks
  incrementally afterwards.
- **Streams on demand** with seeking, plus a local cache so replays are instant.
- **Library** with search, shuffle, a queue, likes and play-position memory.
- **Fills in missing metadata** from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org), cover art from
  [Cover Art Archive](https://coverartarchive.org), and synced lyrics from
  [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net) — all editable and overridable by hand.
- **Sends tracks back to Telegram**: to Saved Messages, or forwarded to a contact (frequent
  recipients first).

## Requirements

Python 3.12+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — the frontend is plain JavaScript with no
build step.

[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) is optional, and only used to write edited metadata into downloaded
files. Without it everything else works and downloads still succeed, they just carry the tags
Telegram already had. The Docker image installs it. On Debian or Ubuntu:
`sudo apt install ffmpeg`.

## Install

```sh
cp .env.example .env
uv sync
uv run python run.py
```

Open <http://localhost:8000> and link Telegram by scanning the QR code with your phone
(Telegram → Settings → Devices → Link Desktop Device), or by phone number.

Edit `.env` and set `MUSICBRAINZ_CONTACT` to an email address you control — MusicBrainz rejects
anonymous requests, so metadata lookups fail without it.

Run via `run.py`, not `uvicorn` directly: it reads the bind address you chose in Settings.
Add `--reload` while developing.

### Docker

```sh
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Security

**By default the player binds to `127.0.0.1` and has no password**, which is safe on a personal
machine. Both are in Settings → Network.

Anyone who reaches this app is logged into your Telegram: they can read your library, see your
contacts, and send messages as you. **Set a password before binding to `0.0.0.0`.** Sessions
last 30 days; changing or removing the password signs every other browser out.

There is no HTTPS here. Over anything other than localhost, put it behind a reverse proxy or a
VPN — the session cookie is only marked `Secure` when the request already arrived over HTTPS.

Example Caddy (TLS, forwarded headers for the `Secure` cookie flag):

```caddyfile
music.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
}
```

With nginx or Traefik, forward `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` — the app reads it via
`--proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips=127.0.0.1` (both already set in the Docker image).

## Your data

Everything lives in `DATA_DIR` (`./data` by default): the SQLite library, the media cache, and
your encrypted Telegram session. The encryption key is generated on first run and stored
alongside it — set `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env` to keep the key out of the directory it
decrypts.

**Back up `DATA_DIR`.** Likes, manual lyrics, metadata overrides and play positions exist
nowhere else; tracks themselves are still safe in Telegram.

## API credentials

A Telegram API registration is built in, so the app works out of the box. Every install that
uses it shares one `api_id`, which Telegram may rate-limit. To use your own, register at
[my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) and set `TELEGRAM_API_ID` and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH`
together in `.env` — half a pair is rejected at startup rather than silently mixed.

## Development

```sh
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests   # backend (layout tests need playwright + chromium)
node --test static/*.test.js                  # player + format + tokens + icons
node --check static/app.js                    # syntax gate
```

CI runs all of the above on every push (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`).

The Hugeicons sprite in `static/index.html` is generated — edit `tools/build_icons.py` and rerun
it, never the sprite by hand:

```sh
npm install                      # Hugeicons, build-time only
python3 tools/build_icons.py     # --check verifies without writing
```
